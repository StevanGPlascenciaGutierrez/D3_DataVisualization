            <div>Video Games weren't always so popular.<br>
                They had a slow start in the 80s and only in the 2000s did they really become such a big deal.
                Games produced in the late 2000s have sold the most copies. This could be due to their long time on the
                market so recent games can be expected to be more in the future.
